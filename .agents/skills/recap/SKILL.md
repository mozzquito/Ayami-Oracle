# /recap — Session Orientation & Awareness

**Goal**: Orient yourself fast. Rich context by default. Mid-session awareness with `--now`.

## Usage

```
/recap           # Rich: retro summary, handoff, tracks, git
/recap --quick   # Minimal: git + focus only, no file reads
/recap --now     # Mid-session: timeline + jumps from AI memory
/recap --now deep # Mid-session: + handoff + tracks + connections
/recap --visual  # Rich, plus a rebuilt Excalidraw session-log board
```

---

## DEFAULT MODE (Rich)

**Run the rich script, then add suggestions:**

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/recap/recap-rich.ts
```

Script reads retro summaries, handoff content, tracks, git state. Then LLM adds:
- **What's next?** (2-3 options based on context)

### Step 1.5: Detect INCUBATED_BY (#229)

The recap-rich.ts script auto-detects `.claude/INCUBATED_BY` breadcrumbs. If present, shows:

```
## ⚠️ INCUBATED REPO
oracle: mawui-oracle
date: 2026-04-13
source: https://github.com/...
```

This tells the oracle: "You are in a repo tracked by another oracle. Check the breadcrumb for context."

### Step 2: Git context

```bash
git status --short
git log --oneline -1
```

Check what's appropriate from git status:
- **Uncommitted changes?** → show them, suggest commit or stash
- **On a branch (not main)?** → `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to see branch work
- **Branch ahead of remote?** → suggest push or PR
- **Clean on main?** → just show last commit, move on

Only read what matters — don't dump 10 commits if status is clean.

### Step 2.5: Skill shelf staleness

Skills are **copied** into `~/.claude/skills/` (fork model), so fixes never
propagate on their own — an oracle can run a superseded skill indefinitely with
nothing to signal it. This surfaces it during orientation, where you'd notice.

```bash
bun "$(dirname "$0")/skills-staleness.ts" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Silent when the shelf is current. Prints only when you are behind, the install is
30+ days old, the manifest can't be reconciled against disk, or `--verbose`.
Never blocks — any failure exits 0 and prints nothing, because orientation must
not break on a diagnostic.

If it reports **BEHIND**, offer the update command it prints; don't run it
unprompted — an install can change the behaviour of skills mid-session.

> Origin: written by neo (`laris-co/neo-oracle`) 2026-08-16 after a `/learn`
> contamination bug was diagnosed in a shelf version that had been superseded
> for two months. Adopted into the shelf so every oracle gets it.

### Step 3: Read latest ψ/ brain files

Sort all ψ/ files by modification time, read the most recent:

```bash
find ψ/ -name '*.md' -not -name 'CLAUDE.md' -not -name 'README.md' -not -name '.gitkeep' 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

Read those top 5 files. This recovers the same context `/compact` restores — handoffs, retros, learnings, drafts, whatever was touched last.

### Step 4: Dig last session

```bash
ORACLE_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
ENCODED_PWD=$(echo "$ORACLE_ROOT" | sed 's|^/|-|; s|[/.]|-|g')
PROJECT_BASE=$(ls -d "$HOME/.claude/projects/${ENCODED_PWD}" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
export PROJECT_DIRS="$PROJECT_BASE"

# Strip -wt* suffix to find parent project dir
PARENT_ENCODED=$(echo "$ENCODED_PWD" | sed 's/-wt-[^/]*$//')
if [ "$PARENT_ENCODED" != "$ENCODED_PWD" ]; then
  PARENT_BASE=$(ls -d "$HOME/.claude/projects/${PARENT_ENCODED}" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$PARENT_BASE" ] && export PROJECT_DIRS="$PROJECT_DIRS:$PARENT_BASE"
fi

# nullglob-safe worktree scan (both parent and self)
for base in "$PROJECT_BASE" "$PARENT_BASE"; do
  [ -z "$base" ] && continue
  for wt in "$base"-wt-*(N); do  # (N) = zsh nullglob qualifier
    [ -d "$wt" ] && export PROJECT_DIRS="$PROJECT_DIRS:$wt"
  done
done

python3 ~/.claude/skills/dig/scripts/dig.py 1
```

Include in recap:
```
📡 Last session: HH:MM–HH:MM (Xm, N msgs) — [topic]
```

Need more? `/dig 5` or `/dig --timeline`.

**Total**: 1 bash call + LLM analysis

---

## QUICK MODE (`/recap --quick`)

**Minimal, no content reads:**

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/recap/recap.ts
```

Script outputs git status + focus state (~0.1s). Then LLM adds:
- **What's next?** (2-3 options based on git state)

---

## VISUAL MODE (`/recap --visual`)

**Opt-in only** — never run this as part of default `/recap`. It is the one recap mode
that touches an external MCP (Excalidraw+), so it stays behind an explicit flag: default
`/recap` must stay fast and offline-safe.

Renders the session history as an Excalidraw board: a capped, **fully rebuilt** view of
the last 25 rows of `session-metrics.md`, not a live-appended log. Rebuilding from that
file (rather than appending during `/rrr`) means the board is a derived artifact — if
Excalidraw is unreachable, nothing is lost, and there's no read-modify-write race between
concurrent sessions writing to the same scene.

### Step 1: Gather data (one bash call)

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/recap/session-board.ts 25
```

Outputs `{ repo, count, entries: [{ when, session, done }] }` — `done` truncated to ~90
chars per entry.

### Step 2: Find or create the scene

Read the pointer file:

```bash
ORACLE_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
PSI=$(readlink -f "$ORACLE_ROOT/ψ" 2>/dev/null || echo "$ORACLE_ROOT/ψ")
cat "$PSI/memory/logs/excalidraw-session-board.md" 2>/dev/null
```

- **Pointer exists** (has a `scene_url:`) → reuse that scene; skip creation.
- **No pointer** → this is the first run for this repo. Before any scene-content write,
  call `read_freeform_format` once (session log is a memo/log, not a diagram — use the
  freeform tool, not `create_diagram`). Then create one scene titled
  `"Ayami Session Log — <repo>"`.

### Step 3: Rebuild the board content

One card per entry: title = `<session> · <when>`, body = the truncated `done` text.
Order oldest→newest or newest-first, your call, but be consistent across rebuilds.
This is a full overwrite of the scene content each time — not an append — so stale
cards from pruned/rotated sessions never accumulate.

### Step 4: Update the pointer file

Write (create or overwrite) `$PSI/memory/logs/excalidraw-session-board.md`:

```markdown
---
scene_url: <url from step 2/3>
repo: <repo>
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
---
```

`ψ/memory/logs/` is local/ephemeral (gitignored) by design — this pointer is
workspace-local state, not something to commit.

### Step 5: Report

Add one line to the recap output:

```
🗺️ Session board: <scene_url> — <count> sessions (<first_session>…<last_session>)
```

### Failure handling

Any MCP error (offline, auth, rate limit) → print
`🗺️ Session board: unavailable (<short reason>)` and continue with the rest of `/recap`
as normal. A visual-mode failure must never block or degrade the core recap output.

## "What's next?" Rules

| If you see... | Suggest... |
|---------------|------------|
| Handoff exists | Continue from handoff |
| Untracked files | Commit them |
| Focus = completed | Pick from tracks or start fresh |
| Branch ahead | Push or create PR |
| Streak active | Keep momentum going |

---

## Hard Rules

1. **ONE bash call** — never multiple parallel calls (adds latency)
2. **No subagents** — everything in main agent
3. **Ask, don't suggest** — "What next?" not "You should..."
4. **Verify pending before reporting** — see "Verify Before Reporting" section below. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.
5. **Print absolute paths** — when referencing vault files, render the resolved `$ROOT/ψ/...` path (starts with `/`). Bare `ψ/...` is not clickable. See CONVENTIONS.md.

---

## Verify Before Reporting (MANDATORY)

Handoffs, retros, and memory files are **point-in-time claims**, not live state. Between the previous session ending and this one starting, work may have been done, PRs may have merged, files may have been copied. **Echoing a stale pending list as if it were current is a lie by omission** — the human ends up chasing items that are already done.

### The rule

Before outputting any "Pending" table or "Next action" suggestion, you MUST verify each claimed pending item against current reality:

| Claim type | How to verify |
|---|---|
| "Copy file X to path Y" | `ls path/Y` — is it already there? |
| "PR #N open/merged" | `gh pr view N --json state` |
| "Branch X needs push" | `git log origin/X..X` — any commits? |
| "Apply pattern P to file F" | `grep` for the pattern in F |
| "Issue #N pending" | `gh issue view N --json state` |
| "Migration ready to run" | check migrations table or list |

### What to do with each verified item

- **Already done** → drop from pending, note in "Actually done since handoff"
- **Still pending** → keep, show in table
- **Partially done** → split into remaining sub-items
- **Can't verify** (offline/ambiguous) → mark `⚠️ unverified` in the table, do not assert state

### The correction pattern

If the handoff pending list and reality diverge (>1 item stale), show the correction explicitly so the human sees the drift:

```
| Item | Handoff said | Reality |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Copy cache/ to maw-ui | pending | DONE (Apr 20 04:16) |
| PR #4 merge | open | MERGED |
```

### Why this is non-negotiable

- Handoffs are written before work stops, but work often continues between sessions (other Oracles, scheduled tasks, user actions).
- Memory files age — an older memory claiming "feature X is broken" may be stale if a fix shipped.
- Humans trust recap output as ground truth. An unverified echo breaks that trust fast.

**Patterns over intentions** — the code is the truth, the handoff is an intention. Always verify.

## NOW MODE (`/recap --now`)

**Mid-session awareness from AI memory** — no file reading needed. Use when user asks "where are we", "now", "status", "what are we doing".

AI reconstructs session timeline from conversation memory:

```markdown
## This Session

| Time | Duration | Topic | Jump |
|------|----------|-------|------|
| HH:MM | ~Xm | First topic | - |
| HH:MM | ~Xm | Second topic | spark |
| HH:MM | ongoing | **Now**: Current | complete |

**Noticed**:
- [Pattern - energy/mode]
- [Jump pattern: sparks vs escapes vs completions]

**Status**:
- Energy: [level]
- Loose ends: [unfinished]
- Parked: [topics we'll return to]

**My Read**: [1-2 sentences]

---
**Next?**
```

### Jump Types

| Icon | Type | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| spark | New idea, exciting |
| complete | Finished, moving on |
| return | Coming back to parked |
| park | Intentional pause |
| escape | Avoiding difficulty |

**Healthy session**: Mostly sparks and completes
**Warning sign**: Too many escapes = avoidance pattern

---

## NOW DEEP MODE (`/recap --now deep`)

Same as `--now` but adds bigger picture context.

### Step 1: Gather (parallel)

```
1. Current session from AI memory
2. Read latest handoff: ls -t ψ/inbox/handoff/*.md | head -1
3. Git status: git status --short
4. Tracks: cat ψ/inbox/tracks/INDEX.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 1.5: VERIFY pending from handoff

Before outputting, run verification checks against each pending item (see "Verify Before Reporting" above). Batch checks in parallel:
- `gh pr list --state all` for PR claims
- `ls path/to/file` for "copy X" claims
- `grep` for "apply pattern" claims

If any diverge from the handoff, show the correction table.

### Step 2: Output

Everything from `--now`, plus:

```markdown
### Bigger Picture

**Came from**: [Last session/handoff summary - 1 line]
**Working on**: [Current thread/goal]
**Thread**: [Larger pattern this connects to]

### Pending

| Priority | Item | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Now | [Current task] | This session |
| Soon | [Next up] | Tracks/discussion |
| Later | [Backlog] | GitHub/tracks |

### Connections

**Pattern**: [What pattern emerged]
**Learning**: [Key insight from session]
**Oracle**: [Related past pattern, if any]

**My Read**: [2-3 sentences - deeper reflection]

**Next action?**
```

## Session Context

The recap scripts (`recap.ts` and `recap-rich.ts`) auto-detect and display the current session:

```
📡 Session: 74c32f34 | arra-oracle-skills-cli | 2h 15m
```

Detection: scans `~/.claude/projects/[encoded-pwd]/*.jsonl` for the most recent session file, extracts short ID and elapsed time from first timestamp.

If session detection fails, skip silently — it's informational only.

---

## Demographics Context

If CLAUDE.md contains demographics from `/awaken` wizard v2, include in recap output:

```markdown
**Oracle**: [name] ([pronouns]) | **Human**: [name] ([pronouns]) | **Language**: [pref]
```

Add this as one line after the timestamp in any mode. If demographics not present, skip silently.

Look for fields in CLAUDE.md: `Human Pronouns`, `Oracle Pronouns`, `Language`, `Team`, `Experience`.

---

**Philosophy**: Detect reality. Surface blockers. Offer direction. *"Not just the clock. The map."*
