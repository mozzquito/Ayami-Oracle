description: '[core] v26.5.16 G-SKLL | Show or bump CalVer version via bun scripts/calver.ts in arra-oracle-skills-cli. Default is dry-run --check. Read-only by default; `--apply` writes package.json. **For full release flow (commit + push + PR), use /release-alpha or /release-stable instead** — /calver alone never commits, pushes, or PRs.'

# /calver

Compute / bump the CalVer version for arra-oracle-skills-cli.

> ⚠️ **Pair with the right skill.** This skill is `--check` (read-only) or `--apply` (writes `package.json` and stops). It does NOT commit, push, or PR — that's deliberate so a bump can never accidentally cut a release.
>
> | Want to… | Use |
> |---|---|
> | See the next target version | `/calver` (default = `--check`) |
> | Just bump `package.json` and stop | `/calver --apply` |
> | Cut a soak release (alpha pre-release) | `/release-alpha` |
> | Cut a stable release on main | `/release-stable` |
> | Land a code fix without releasing | regular branch + PR — keep `package.json` version untouched |
>
> **Never** combine a `package.json` bump with a code fix in the same commit on this repo — `calver-release.yml` auto-tags on push to `main`, so a fix-PR with a bump = automatic stable release.

CalVer scheme: `v{yy}.{m}.{d}[-(alpha|beta).{HMM}]` — HMM is the wall-clock as decimal `H*100 + M` with no leading zero (e.g. 09:37 → `937`, 23:59 → `2359`). Each minute is a unique slot — no merge-order collisions. Alpha and beta are independent channels (#754 / PR #783). Walks git tags AND `package.json.version` for source-of-truth (#784 / PR #786). TZ fixed to Asia/Bangkok. HMM replaced monotonic counter (#766/#775) in #923.

Day-of-month `D` may exceed 31 — used as a stable counter once natural date is exhausted (#930). E.g. `v26.4.50` is the 50th stable cut in the period, not "April 50".

## Step 0: Locate arra-oracle-skills-cli

Always resolve repo via `ghq` so the skill works from any cwd:

```bash
ARRA=$(ghq list -p --exact Soul-Brews-Studio/arra-oracle-skills-cli 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -z "$ARRA" ]; then
  echo "❌ arra-oracle-skills-cli not found via ghq. Run: ghq get github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/arra-oracle-skills-cli"
  exit 1
fi
echo "🕐 $(date '+%H:%M %Z (%A %d %B %Y)')"
echo "📁 $ARRA"
```

## Modes

### Default — dry-run check (show next target)

```bash
TZ=Asia/Bangkok bun "$ARRA/scripts/calver.ts" --check
```

Shows the next target version (`max(tag-walk, package.json) + 1` for today's date+channel). No files modified.

### `--apply` — bump package.json

```bash
TZ=Asia/Bangkok bun "$ARRA/scripts/calver.ts"
```

Writes the next version to `package.json`. Caller then:

```bash
git -C "$ARRA" add package.json && git -C "$ARRA" commit -m "bump: v<version>"
```

Do NOT auto-commit — hand off to user so they can bundle with other changes.

### `--stable` — cut stable (no alpha/beta suffix)

```bash
TZ=Asia/Bangkok bun "$ARRA/scripts/calver.ts" --stable
```

### `--beta` — cut beta (parallel channel, independent counter)

```bash
TZ=Asia/Bangkok bun "$ARRA/scripts/calver.ts" --beta
```

`--stable` and `--beta` are mutually exclusive (script exits 2).

### `--hour N` — REMOVED

The `--hour` flag is deprecated as of #766 and will exit 2. CalVer now uses a monotonic counter walked from git tags + `package.json` — there is no hour-bucket to override.

### `--help` — print calver.ts help

```bash
TZ=Asia/Bangkok bun "$ARRA/scripts/calver.ts" --help
```

## After apply

**Stop. Hand off to the user.** Do NOT auto-commit, do NOT push, do NOT open a PR. The whole point of /calver being read-only-or-stop-after-write is so a bump can never accidentally turn into a release.

If the user wants to ship the bump, they invoke a release skill:

```
Next steps (user runs one of these — not /calver):
  /release-alpha    — soak channel, PR to alpha, calver-release.yml cuts pre-release on merge
  /release-stable   — stable channel (planned), PR to main, calver-release.yml cuts stable on merge
```

If the user is doing code-only work (no release), tell them to **revert** the package.json change before opening the PR. Bumping in a non-release branch is the exact failure mode /release-alpha was built to prevent.

## Notes

- The calver.ts script is authoritative. Do NOT hand-compute versions.
- Release workflow: `calver-release.yml` tags on push to main when package.json version differs from latest tag. Post-#767, alphas merge to `alpha` branch (no tags created until stable cut to main); the script handles this by walking package.json (#784 / PR #786).
- Spec: `ψ/inbox/2026-04-18_proposal-calver-skills-cli.md` (mawjs-oracle vault).
- Umbrella issue: #526 (maw-js — original); #284 (arra-oracle-skills-cli — this port).
- Related changes today (2026-04-28): #775 (monotonic counter), PR #783 (--beta channel for #754), PR #786 (package.json walk for #784).
