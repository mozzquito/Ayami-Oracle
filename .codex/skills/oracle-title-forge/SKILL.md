# /oracle-title-forge — forge a title that has life, honestly

> Born 2026-07-09 turning the dead "ผ่าไส้ Discord Channel ของ Claude Code" into
> **"Claude Code Channel ปะทะ Hermes Gateway — สองสถาปัตยกรรมที่ทำให้ AI คุยบน Discord ได้…"**
> The lesson: a great title is *grown from understanding what the thing IS*, not shuffled from words.

## Why the method works (read this first)

A dead title fails one specific way: it has **clarity without intrigue**. "ผ่าไส้ X" tells you
the topic and nothing else — no tension, no question, no stake. Every principle below exists to
add intrigue *without lying*. The magic isn't wordsmithing; it's that each step forces you to
understand the material more deeply, and the title falls out of that understanding.

## The method — 7 moves

### 1. Describe before you name
Never start by brainstorming words. First write **what each thing IS** — once vividly, once in
plain technical terms. The title grows from this. (For the Discord book, writing "the plugin is
a stdio bridge tied to a session's lifecycle; Hermes is an always-on daemon" is what *revealed*
the contest.)

### 2. Find the real tension — and check it's not forged
If it's a comparison/VS, run a **skeptic pass**: is the contest real or clickbait? Two things at
different layers can't fight on features. Reframe the tension at the honest layer — *philosophy,
fit, tradeoff* — not a fake feature-fight. A title promising a showdown the book can't deliver is
a lie. (Discord book: they're transport vs runtime — so the contest is "two philosophies of
presence," which is true, not "which codes better," which is false.)

### 3. Prism the candidates — 3-5 lenses
Look at each candidate from angles a single view misses. Useful lenses for titles:
- **🏪 Bookshelf browser** — does the spine make someone pick it up?
- **💀 Honest skeptic** — does the title over-promise? name only one side of a two-sided story?
- **🧑‍💻 Dev-ear** — *would a developer actually say this phrase?* Kill words devs don't use
  ("ให้ AI พูด" → "AI คุยบน Discord"; "ต่อ AI เข้ากับ Discord" → clunky; "data เข้าทางไหน" ✓ real).
- **✍️ Thai editor** — cadence, clean noun phrases, cut stray connectors (ด้วย/ต่อ...เข้ากับ).
- **🎯 Precision** — does the subtitle name the *real axes*, not vague adjectives?

### 4. Apply the craft principles (from title research)
- **Tension = clarity × intrigue.** The reader must grasp *something* instantly AND be compelled
  to open it for the rest.
- **Contrast breeds curiosity.** Unexpected/opposed words hook ("The Wealthy Barber"). A "ปะทะ" /
  "vs" between two named things is contrast built-in.
- **Formula: short curious head + longer explaining subtitle.** Head = hook (1-6 words / a clash /
  a question). Subtitle = context + payoff.
- **Question form** raises the stakes above the mechanism ("ใครควรได้…").
- **Cadence / list-of-three** makes the subtitle linger ("data ขาเข้า, การคุมสิทธิ์, วงจรชีวิต").

### 5. Calibrate register with the human
Draft, then dial. Common arc: *clinical → too poetic → eloquent-but-technical*. The target for
technical work: **สละสลวยแต่ตรง, ไม่เล่นอุปมามาก** — pleasant to the ear, but every phrase points
at something real in the code. Show the human one sample paragraph in the proposed voice and let
their taste calibrate. Their "แปลกๆ" is data — chase the specific weird word.

### 6. Name the real technical axes in the subtitle
Don't sell with adjectives ("powerful, elegant"). Sell with the **concrete things the piece
compares/covers** — the axes a practitioner cares about (data path, access control, lifecycle),
ending on the payoff ("ตัวไหนเหมาะกับงานแบบใด").

### 7. Honesty is a feature, not a weakness
Refuse the cheap winner. "Generic: it's a tie on different axes; situational: here's the matrix"
reads as *more* authoritative than "X wins." A title/frame that promises an honest verdict earns
trust the clickbait can't.

## Output shape
Offer **2-3 candidates**, each *described by the feeling it gives + the craft reason it works*
(not a bare list), recommend one with why, then render the full cover block (head + subtitle) so
the human sees it assembled. End by asking which — let taste decide the last 5%.

## Proven example
```
# Claude Code Channel ปะทะ Hermes Gateway
สองสถาปัตยกรรมที่ทำให้ AI คุยบน Discord ได้ — เทียบตั้งแต่ data ไหลเข้าทางไหน
คุมสิทธิ์การเข้าถึงยังไง ไปจนถึงว่าตัวไหนเหมาะกับงานแบบใด
```
Head = two named contenders + ปะทะ (contrast). Subtitle = 3 real axes + payoff. Register =
eloquent but dev-natural. Verdict promised = honest (fit, not a fake winner).

(oracle-write-complete-book / -booklet / -combine-blogs) that consume the forged title.

## Book mode

A book title carries more weight than an article's: it is the spine text, the search
result, and the thing someone repeats to a friend. Two extra constraints on top of the
7 moves:

- **Spine test** — say it out loud as if recommending it. If it needs a subtitle to make
  sense spoken, the main title is doing too little.
- **Shelf test** — write it next to three real books in the same genre. Generic titles
  vanish; that is the whole signal.
- Subtitle carries the technical axes (the 7 moves already say this); the **main title
  carries the tension**. Do not let the subtitle rescue a dead title.

## Then: the cover

**This skill does not draw.** Stated plainly because the alternative is pretending:

| capability | present here |
|---|---|
| generative image tool (Imagen / DALL-E / SD) | **no** — no such tool in this session |
| `codex` CLI | yes — but codex does not generate images either |
| ImageMagick (`convert` / `magick`) | yes — **composition only**: type on a ground, crops, gradients |
| typst | yes — vector/typographic covers rendered with the book |

So a cover here is one of two honest things: **found art** (licence-checked) or a
**typographic composition**. Neither is "the AI drew it", and neither should be described
that way.

**Hand off to `/oracle-book-cover`** — it already does this properly: finds real art with a
LICENCE gate, runs a 5-lens prism (Reader / Editor / Artist / Designer / Ads), renders 2-3
PNG candidates, bakes the winner into the `book.typ` cover block only, and exports social
crops. Do not rebuild that pipeline here.

```text
/oracle-title-forge   → title + subtitle
        ↓
/oracle-book-cover    → art (licence-checked) or typographic cover → book.typ
```

If `/oracle-book-cover` is not installed on this machine, say so and stop — do not
improvise a cover with `convert` and call it a design. A typographic fallback is legitimate
only when the human asks for it knowing no illustration is involved.

**Delegating to codex**: `/codex:rescue` or the `codex-rescue` agent can take a
cover-generation *task* (typst layout, ImageMagick composition, asset wrangling). It cannot
produce an illustration. If someone asks "get codex to draw it", the answer is that no
agent in this fleet has an image model — the work has to be found art, vector, or type.
