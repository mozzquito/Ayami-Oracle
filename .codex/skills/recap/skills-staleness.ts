// skills-staleness.ts — is your installed Oracle skill shelf behind the source?
//
// Originally written by neo (laris-co/neo-oracle) on 2026-08-16; adopted into the
// shelf so every oracle gets it, not just neo. Two corrections on adoption are
// marked [ADOPTED] below.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-16): staleness discovery was circular — the only way to
// learn you were behind was to run an install, which required already knowing you
// needed one. Result: a /learn contamination bug was diagnosed in a shelf version
// that had been superseded for two months, and nobody noticed. The fork install
// model (files copied into ~/.claude/skills) means fixes never propagate on their
// own; a managed/subscribe route would, which is the real argument for offering one.
//
// The data was always on disk. Nothing read it. This reads it.
//
// DESIGN RULES (each earned the hard way):
//  - Never block. Any failure prints nothing and exits 0. Orientation must not break.
//  - No network by default. `git ls-remote` on session start is a latency tax.
//  - NEVER claim "up to date" from a source you haven't verified is current. A local
//    ghq clone can itself be stale — so report the clone's own fetch age alongside its
//    version, rather than presenting it as upstream truth.
//
// Usage:  bun skills-staleness.ts            # quiet unless something's off
//         bun skills-staleness.ts --verbose  # always print what it found
